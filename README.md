## Configuration

If you wish to change any of the mod's functionalities, for example to disable a specific randomizer, a configuration file (`Rainbomizer.cfg`) has been provided with the mod. The config file is located in the game's root directory.

The default configuration file is in the main repository, `Rainbomizer.cfg`, and is automatically created by the mod if it doesn't exist in the game folder.

The configuration file is in the CFG format.

To configure a specific randomizer, search for its name in the configuration file. You can set it to 'true' or 'false' to enable or disable it respectively.

Configuration options marked with '# Experimental' are not fully complete and will still have issues.

More information about how to configure specific randomizers is provided in the default config file.

## Installation

1) Downgrade to 1.0 (download link available above)
2) Put the ASI and CFG files into your GTA Vice City directory.
